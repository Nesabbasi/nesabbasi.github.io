abstract: "Hybrid Rebeca is introduced for modeling asynchronous event-based Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). In this work, we extend Hybrid Rebeca to allow the modeling of non-deterministic time behavior. We provide a set of rules to define the semantic model of Hybrid Rebeca models in terms of Time Transition Systems which represents an over-approximation of the reachable states of a Hybrid Rebeca model. Then, we adapt the reachability analysis algorithm of Flow∗ for Hybrid Rebeca models leveraging our semantic rules. This improves the analysis significantly because the previous technique relied on the reachability analysis of hybrid automata by deriving a monolithic hybrid automaton from a given Hybrid Rebeca model, leading to a huge hybrid automaton. We illustrate the applicability of our approach through a case study."
