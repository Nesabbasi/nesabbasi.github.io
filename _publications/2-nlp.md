abstract: "This project investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for the Persian language. While models like ChatGPT demonstrate exceptional performance in English, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like Persian remains underexplored. We conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study focusing on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and OpenChat-3.5 across various tasks, including classic, reasoning, and knowledge-based categories. Notably, we introduced two new benchmarks for reasoning tasks due to the scarcity of existing datasets. Our findings indicate that while LLMs excel in reasoning, task-specific fine-tuned models often outperform them in specific areas, underscoring the potential for enhancing LLM performance in Persian."
